The repository computer vision is the analysis of the solution to the problem Carvana Image Masking Challenge from kaggle.com given by Alexander Ershov in his video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82U_biezRUw&t=901s.  Take images and masks from https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge/data
I repeated the code given in the video in the VS. I used VS because wanted to see how VS works with Python. I try to explain to me every turn of Alexander Ershov in the video. Therefore, the code is full of comments. 
There was a problem with libraries CUDA, due to the fact that I have a Radeon graphic card.
There was a problem with matplotlib for which new windows had to be opened. I have used multiprocessing for fix it.
